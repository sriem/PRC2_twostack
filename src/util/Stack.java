 * An implementing class should either provide auto-growth of the stack or
 * provide a constructor parameter to set the size once and for all (for that
 * instance). In the latter case, a unspecified (and unchecked) RuntimeException
 * may be thrown on overflow.</p>

 * An implementing class does not have to shrink it's storage capacity after it
 * has grown. A typical stack will find its size during use and may keep that
 * obviously required capacity.</p>
